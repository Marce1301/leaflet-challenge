The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

### 1)Get your dataset
The data that I used came from USGS GeoJSON Feed https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php from were I used  the geojson info of "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days".

### 2)Import and visualize the data
Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

* The  data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

* It includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

* The map has a legend that will provide context for your map data.

The resulted map should looks like this:
